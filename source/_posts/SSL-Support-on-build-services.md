Look at the various 'build' services out there (like Netlify, Surge, Google App Engine, Heroku etc.) and see how easy it is to add a custom domain and SSL to a project and what cost there is to do this.

Found a good list of service at https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/deploying-and-hosting/ which would be a starting point for this.
